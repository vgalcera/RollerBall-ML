Unity project example with Machine Learning Agents Toolkit (https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)

These files are the demo of my presentation "Machine Learning and the videogames":
https://www.slideshare.net/VanessaGalcera/machine-learning-con-unity


The zip contains the Unity project with the scenes, scripts, TensorFlow models examples, etc. 

NOTE: The Unity project doesn't contain the full ML-Agent directory, only the TF models.

To install Unity ML-Agents toolkit follow the oficial documentation:
